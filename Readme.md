I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and affiliated with the [Pratt & Whitney Institute for Advanced Systems Engineering](https://utc-iase.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut. I received an M.S. and B.s. degrees in Chemical Engineering with a focus on mathematical programming, optimization and planning from the Incheon National University (INU), Incheon, Republic of Korea.

My current research work lies in system health monitoring in the manufacturing industry using physics-informed machine learning, data-driven models (machine learning and deep learning). In addition, during master degree, I have worked on design and operation of reneable energy supply system using mathematical programming and optimization, evaluating the impact of meteorological change, energy storage, and future demand structure on the systems. I have two years experience in analyzing carbon utilization strategies (in particular, energy production from coke oven gas) and bioethanol production & supply strategies under WEFL nexus using process simulating and optimization at Innovation Center for Chemical Engineering, Republic of Korea.
